This is Sokoban made in Excel, 100+ levels and works like a charm. 
It also has an editor so you can create and edit levels.

Altough some things are in Dutch and not yet translated to English, Most stuff can be easily understand, and it can be played.
For people not yet known to the consept, use the arrowkeys to move the boxes in the green spaces (don't forget to enable macro's ofc)
This code is here to help people, and to let people see what you can do in Excel. Feel free to use the codes written here, just thank or credit me if you do ;)
